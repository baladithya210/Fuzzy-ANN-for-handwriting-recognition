# Fuzzy-ANN-for-handwriting-recognition
Used a handwritten digit dataset  MNIST and Applied fuzzy logic to preprocess the input features, where each pixel value can be fuzzified into linguistic terms (e.g., "dark," "light"). • Used an ANN model to classify the fuzzified inputs into corresponding digits (0-9).
